Welcome to CARLA Simulator!
===========================

This Makefile will help you building the different CARLA utilities.

Use the following commands:

    help:

        Display this help message.

    launch:

        Compile CarlaUE4 project and launch it in Unreal Engine's Editor.

    launch-only:

        Launch CarlaUE4 project in Unreal Engine's Editor, but skip building
        step (assume the project is already built).

    docs:

        Build CARLA Doxygen's documentation.

    clean:

        Remove intermediate build files.

    rebuild:

        Remove intermediate build files and rebuild the whole project.

    hard-clean:

        Remove intermediate build files and dependencies, and force a
        recompilation of Unreal Engine's pre-compiled headers. Useful for
        fixing "version.h has been modified since the precompiled header"
        errors, but recompilation takes a long time.


There are also some lower level commands for building individual modules helpful
for developers:

    check:

        Run unit test suites for CarlaLib and PythonAPI.

    CarlaUE4Editor:

        Build CarlaUE4 project, but do not launch the editor.

    PythonAPI:

        Build and package the Python API module for Python 2 and 3.

    CarlaLib:

        Build the CarlaLib library both "Server" and "Client" configurations.

    setup:

        Run the setup step only.

    pretty:

        Prettify code files. Run uncrustify on CarlaLib C++ files.
